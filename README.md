# SE-Gorup10-CI

CI server implementation

## How to run

For first time users of the server, run the shell script with a port number and ngrok auth token:

    ./run_ngrok.sh PORT_NUMBER AUTH_TOKEN

After running the program for the first time, the shell script can be called subsequent times with only the port number:

    ./run_ngrok.sh PORT_NUMBER
